== Description ==

This is The Events Calendar Summary View Extension. It adds a terrific new variation of List View to your calendar.
The Summary View, also known as an "agenda view" lists events by day in a compact format, with dates on the left and events on the right - allowing easy scanning of events.
it also shows multiday events on each day they occur, with notes for starting and ending dates.

Some important things to note:
While the Summary view has no settings itself, it is affected by other view settings -
such as the limit on events for list views and whether recurring events only show on the first occurrence or for every occurrence.

Yes! The Summary View uses the same [templating system](https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/k/calendar-template-files-v2/) as our default views, so customizations are just as easy!
